# ICS-635-HW4

A neural netwrok with a single hidden layer coded from scratch (using only Numpy and xlogy from scipy). With this, it's easy to see how fully-connected neural networks with several layers are built. This neural network implements minibatch stochastic gradient descent. It is applied to the Fashion MNIST dataset.
